# TheMatrix
Helps you to settle bills after a trip

Suppose you are making a trip with 5 friends: Erik (yourself), Roger, Danny, Ann and Maritza. You have lunch somewhere and Erik pays the bill (150 euro). Later you split, the men go mountainbiking. Roger pays the bikes (75 euro). The ladies go wellnessing and Ann pays for both (90 euro). For the hotel bill, Danny wants to pay but he only has 200 euro left. The other 135 euro comes from Roger.

Enter in The Matrix :

Erik : 150  participants = Erik,Roger,Danny,Ann,Maritza.

Roger : 75  participants = Erik, Roger, Danny.

Ann : 90 participants = Ann, Maritza.

Danny : 200  Roger : 135  participants = Erik,Roger,Danny,Ann,Maritza.

The Matrix will settle as follows:

Erik receives 28.

Roger receives 88.

Danny receives 78.

Ann pays 52.

Maritza pays 142.
